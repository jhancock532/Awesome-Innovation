## Project Planning

* [Microsoft Office Planner](https://tasks.office.com/bristol.ac.uk/en-US/Home/Planner/) <br>
  Free : Every student already has an Office 365 account, so no sign up required. Easy to use. ★★★
* [Trello](https://trello.com) <br>
  Free : Requires sign up. Just as easy as the above, limited "power ups" such as calendar view before you have to pay. ★★
  
## Doing Work (File Storage, Sharing, Editing)

* [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com) <br>
  Free : A better version of Google Drive (it has real time collaboration on all documents). The online editor for Word isn't as smooth as Docs, but that doesn't matter because you'd use the normal Word software anyway. OneDrive is where you will store and share all your project files. ★★★
  
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/) <br>
  Free : Reliable. Does what it needs to do, and all in your web browser. Has nifty tools like OCR and countless custom apps for various tasks (which I've never used). Stuff like Google Sites and Google My Maps are its real unique selling point ★★★
  
## Blogging

* [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) <br>
  Free : When Travis or Keir ask you to keep a blog of your adventures on a project, this is probably what you'll use. Super friendly for non coders. ★★★
  
## Making Surveys

* [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/) <br>
  Free : Does everything you need it to. You can add sections, videos and descriptive text passages. ★★★
* [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?origin=shell#) <br>
  Free : Does everything you need it to. You can see how long on average people take to complete the survey. Allows branching so you can skip questions that aren't relevant. ★★★
* [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) <br>
  Free : But for pro features you need to pay. Requires sign up. It's not worth the hassle, unless you need some obscure feature. ★

## App Prototyping

* [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com/#/) <br> 
  Free : It requires basic levels of coding knowledge if you want it to do something fancy, if not, it's a drag and drop app creator. Creates an actual app file for android and iOS devices. ★★
* [Marvelapp](https://marvelapp.com/) <br> 
  Free : Create an app from photos, complete with neat animations. Limit on number of apps that can be created for free. TBH, I would use several pieces of paper instead for prototyping, but if you want something that looks fancy for a later prototype, this will get you there (if you are good with image editing). ★
  
## Web Prototyping

* [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new?usp=jotspot_si) <br>
  Free : So easy, and it's hosted for you with no charge. There is a subtle banner at the bottom, and it might not be flexible enough for everything you want it to do. Suitable for poeple who have no coding experience. ★★
* [CodePen](https://codepen.com) <br>
  Free : Quickly code your web ideas and host them online for free. I use this a lot when coding with Javascript. Not suitable for non coders, sorry. ★★
  
## Arty Stuff!

* [Word Cloud Generator](https://www.wordclouds.com/) <br>
  Free : Really easy to use, no download or sign up required. Perfect for what you need it to do. ★★★
