## Project Planning

* [Microsoft Office Planner](https://tasks.office.com/bristol.ac.uk/en-US/Home/Planner/)
  Free : Every student already has an Office 365 account, so no sign up required. Easy to use.
* [Trello](https://trello.com)
  Free : Requires sign up. Just as easy as the above, limited "power ups" such as calendar view before you have to pay.
