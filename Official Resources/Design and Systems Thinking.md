### Unit Description
[This describes what the module is and what you are learning from it.](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=18%2F19&unitCode=INOV10001)  **Read it!**

### Other Resources
That's it. There isn't a reading list for this unit, but with the below link you shouldn't need one:

#### [Awesome Design and Systems Thinking](https://github.com/robinstickel/awesome-design-principles#readme) 

It's an unbelieveable amount of resources. That URL contains links to over 100 times the knowledge I have of Design and Systems thinking, and I'm really sad that I only discovered it after finishing the module. That single link is worth a lot more than the 20 credit Design and Systems Thinking module, that link is a degree in itself.
