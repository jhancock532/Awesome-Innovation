## Tips From Tom


**Consider your methods**

It helps if you've thought through the methods you might use to tackle this challenge. This means beyond 'doing interviews' to thinking about what kind of interviews, how, when, with who. Pull out your notes from last year or to spark ideas about new methods, take a look at: https://www.thisisservicedesigndoing.com/methods or http://www.designkit.org/methods

**Think about your overall approach**

Think about how a more agile approach is the same or different to what you did last year. What does this mean for the way you approach this project? For a couple interesting perspectives consider reading this new Harvard Business Review article that touches on both agile and design thinking https://hbr.org/2018/11/bring-your-breakthrough-ideas-to-life or this one from 2016 https://hbr.org/2016/05/embracing-agile; consider 'modern agile' http://modernagile.org/; or take a more personal leadership perspective by watching this TED talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWMS5wDSPs8 

**Find other examples**

Find out what others are saying about agile project planning. Often, it's more about setting key milestones than needing to predict every single twist and turn up front. Government Digital Services (GDS) has a great blog where you could look for examples or check out their perspective on agile project planning https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/planning-agile 

Think of ethics as something to bring together your values as a team (any connections with your team canvas?) and guide your work - It's a good thing! 

Often, ethics is seen as a hurdle because of the process-based nature of the application. BUT this is an opportunity for your team to agree how you are going to work, how you are going to keep yourself safe during that work and how you are going to protect and respect those you are trying to learn about (ie: your participants). Check out the Little Book of Ethics over in the 'Unit slides and Materials' tab to see that there is more to ethics than the paperwork. :) Also, don't forget to look at the examples in the 'ethics' tab. You can copy directly from the ethics samples - giving you permission here - don't worry about plagiarism in this case, there is no point in recreating the wheel as long as you've read and agree with what you are copying or are altering parts to fit your project. 

PS: Please be sure everyone on your team has read and agreed with the ethics you submit BEFORE you submit them! This should not be a one-person task to submit.
