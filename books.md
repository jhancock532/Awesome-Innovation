#### Suggest your own books!

To show engagement with the innovation course, you should probably show engagement with innovation reading material. 

Don't read and then forget. Use markers to keep track of insights, then write up thoughts in your journal (With quotes and page numbers!). 

## Innovation Books

* Think Like an Artist - To be reviewed (need to re-read this one, plenty of innovation material)
* Cracking Creativity - How to come up with ideas. This book is on your reading list. You should read it.
* Life's a Pitch - How to pitch an idea, and how to live life successfully. Surprisingly similar. An insight on every page.
* The Ten Faces of Innovation - It's on the reading list, but I didn't make it past the second page. To be reviewed.

## Less Relevant, But Interesting Books

* Into The Woods - How stories work. Underlying story structure and story archetype theory. (Stories are very important!)
