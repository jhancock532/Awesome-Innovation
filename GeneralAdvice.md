## On reflective essay writing

* Your innovation essay isn't just about reading books, literally anything that shows how you are "engaging with the course" can be thrown in there. To inspire you, here are some things I've put into various essays. <br><br>
  - Discourse on the blue rubber bands that hold together bunches of spring onions in Bristol.<br>
  *Showing awareness of the larger system in which we design in, focusing on the impact of even the smallest design choice.*
  - Observations from sitting on a bench for two hours.<br>
  *Investigation into the fundamentals of observation practice, leading to an insight about how to approach innovation practice as a whole*
  - Referencing proof that we should ideate alone.<br>
  *Just being controversial really.*

## On meeting the requirements of the coursework

* Read through the brief document. Finding it is the first challenge, so be sure to save it to your desktop and the team's shared file system. Proceed to summerise all the vital information of the brief document in another document - if it's a good brief, you'll be writing out basically everything. Engaging in the brief in this way will help you understand it, later on you will forget some of the details, so never be afraid to return to it if you are confused.
