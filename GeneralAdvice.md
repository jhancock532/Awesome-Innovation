## On reflective essay writing

* Your innovation essay isn't just about reading books, literally anything that shows how you are "engaging with the course" can be thrown in there. To inspire you, here are some things I've put into various essays. <br><br>
  - Discourse on the blue rubber bands that hold together bunches of spring onions in Bristol.<br>
  *Showing awareness of the larger system in which we design in, focusing on the impact of even the smallest design choice.*
  - Observations from sitting on a bench for two hours.<br>
  *Investigation into the fundamentals of observation practice, leading to an insight about how to approach innovation practice as a whole*
  - Referencing proof that we should ideate alone.<br>
  *Just being controversial really.*

**Disclaimer - If any of this advice doesn't work, make sure to write about it in our innovation journal**
