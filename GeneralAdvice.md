# General Advice of Dubious Quality
This advice is from what I've learned over one year of studying innovation. Expect a mixed bag in terms of quality, and treat anything that you think as being sensible with suspision.

## On reflective essay writing

* Your innovation essay isn't just about reading books, literally anything that shows how you are "engaging with the course" can be thrown in there. Here are some things I've put into various essays. <br><br>
  - Discourse on the blue rubber bands that hold together bunches of spring onions in Bristol.<br>
  *Showing awareness of the larger system in which we design in, focusing on the impact of how even the smallest design choice effects the overall system.*
  - Observations from sitting on a bench for two hours.<br>
  *Investigation into the fundamentals of observation practice, leading to an insight about how to approach innovation practice as a whole*
  - Referencing proof that we should ideate alone.<br>
  *Just being controversial really. (But seriously, ideate alone for more ideas and higher quality ideas. Read Quiet by Susan Cain for more information)*

## On meeting the requirements of the coursework

* Read through the brief document. Finding it is the first challenge, so be sure to save it to your desktop and the team's shared file system. Proceed to summerise all the vital information of the brief document in another document - if it's a good brief, you'll be writing out basically everything. Engaging in the brief in this way will help you understand it, later on you will forget some of the details, so never be afraid to return to it and refresh yourself.

## On team leaders, or perhaps team organisers

* Nominate a team leader in one of your earlier meetings. It doesn't matter if they aren't a leader, if you read "Do Lead" you'll find that no leader completely follows the conventional idea of what you think a leader is. All your team really need is someone they trust. 
  - Someone they trust to understand the brief, to know what needs to be done, and to stop the session going too far off track. 
  - Someone they trust to organise meetings, to keep an eye on the deadlines, and maybe have a rough timeplan set out.
  - Someone they trust to be respectful and will keep decisions made democratic.
* You can give them extra equity as a bonus, or agree to reduce their workload elsewhere.
* Naturally with the increased responsibility team leaders hold they'll become more attached to the project than other team members. This might lead the team leader to take ownership of the project. (Just something to think about...)
* The "team leader" I've described above is more like a team organiser, a minimum team role required to ensure that things run smoothly. **But don't let yourself be limited by my minimum requirement definition of a leader.** Maybe your team works better with a visionary, motiviational team leader who focuses on big ideas, while the details of meetings and a time plan are sorted out by the team administrator. Experiment and see what works for your team.

## On writing ideas down

* You need one person in your team which everyone trusts to note down, or "capture" ideas. This role can pass from person to person, and is incredibily easy to acquire, as nobody really wants to do it. As soon as someone comes up with an idea, make a note of it, and don't make selective notes of ideas, capture **every** idea that comes up. Determining the level of detail with which you should capture is difficult, but you'll get a feel of it depending on the situation. 
* For capturing to work successfully requires the team to trust the note taker. Do the people you are capturing from trust that you are making comphensive notes of everything they think is important? If they don't, they'll be anxious that their ideas are being forgotten, instead of thinking of new ideas, or expanding on their idea.

## On equity share sheets

* Discuss the equity share sheets throughout the project, making sure everybody understands and is happy with what they have contributed to project so far. If they feel like their current percentage isn't high enough, then they can take on extra work to boost their equity score. If you do this even once at the midway review of your project, you will save regrets later of people saying "I wish I had done a bit more".
* Write down what you've done - keep a record. If you are a team leader you could keep track of what everyone does.

## On reading books

* Don't read and then forget. Use markers (tear up postit notes) to keep track of insights, then write up thoughts in your journal. Noting quotes and page numbers will help your essay referencing. 
* Give yourself time to read and think, and don't leave it to late on in the term. Get ahead when you have a lull in other work.

## Really general advice

 * So many cool opportuinities are happening in Bristol, and you will reap the benefits of many of them if you simply turn up.
   - Keep an eye on the careers service website.
   - Join a mixture of facebook groups you are interested in and keep an eye on them too.
   - Read the newsletter emails sent out to you, they contain plenty of opportuinities. 
 * Experiment and explore. Understand that you have time to make mistakes and it doesn't really matter the outcome of what you do. It's a learning experience, and you are at University to learn.
 
## Lastly, but most importantly...
 
 * Keep your friends close, reaching out to them often. Ask them if they want a pint / a coffee / a game, and take time to listen and chat with them about how things are going. If you see a potential friend in someone, make the effort, it's worth it. Friendships take time. 
   
   *University is a really rough place for those who feel alone. If you feel strongly about this, like I do, we should get in touch.*
