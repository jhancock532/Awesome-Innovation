# An Introduction

Hi!

This course is an "interesting" course. Like an art course, you are expected to explore the course theme in your own time, and in your own direction (A-Levels in STEM subjects did not prepare me for this whatsoever). To make it easier for everyone involved, I'm curating this library of resources and materials.

It includes
 * Websites to get things done.
 * Books for your reflective essays.
 * Any other interesting resources, really.
 
I'll be adding to this Github repository over time, and I would appreciate any additions you want to share. 
Message me on Facebook, drop a line at jh17112@my.bristol.ac.uk or tweet whatever it is to [@jh531](https://twitter.com/jh531)
