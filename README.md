# An Innovation Introduction

Hi!

This course is an "interesting" course. Like an art course, you are expected to explore the course theme in your own time, and in your own direction (A-Levels in STEM subjects did not prepare me for this whatsoever). To make it easier for everyone involved, I'm curating this library of resources and materials.

It includes
 * Websites to get things done.
 * Books for your reflective essays.
 * General interesting resources and advice
 
I'll be adding to this Github repository over time, and I would really appreciate any additions you want to share. Drop a line at jh17112@my.bristol.ac.uk.

James
