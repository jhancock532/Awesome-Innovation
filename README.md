## Introduction

Hi!

This course is slightly unconventional. To make it easier for everyone involved, I'm hosting this shared library of resources, materials and advice.

It includes
 * Free software/websites to get things done.
 * Material for your reflective essays.
 * Links to unit information.
 
Together we can help each other make the most of this course. Use the following form to submit your own resource!
