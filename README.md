## An Introduction

Hi!

This course is slightly unconventional. To make it easier for everyone involved, I'm curating this library of resources, materials and advice.

It includes
 * Websites to get things done.
 * Books for your reflective essays.
 * Advice of dubious quality.
 
I'll be adding to this Github repository over time, and I would appreciate any additions you want to share.
