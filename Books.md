## General Advice

Don't read and then forget. Use markers (tear up postit notes) to keep track of insights, then write up thoughts in your journal. Noting quotes and page numbers will help your essay referencing. 

Give yourself time to read and think, and don't leave it to late on in the term. Get ahead when you have a lull in other work.

## Innovation Books

* [Think Like an Artist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Artist-Creative-Productive/dp/0241970806) <br>
  Explains how to think like an artist. I should read it again. ★★★

  How to pitch an idea, and also "how to live life successfully" (you have been warned). A good insight on most pages - too many insights, almost. ★★★
* [The Innovator's DNA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-DNA-Mastering-Skills-Disruptive/dp/1422134814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421874&sr=1-1&keywords=the+innovators+dna) <br>
  For business people. Contains five key "discovery skills". Good section on experimenting, not really worth 23 pounds though. ★★
* [The Ten Faces of Innovation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Faces-Innovation-Strategies-Heightening/dp/1781256152/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421841&sr=1-1&keywords=ten+faces+of+innovation) <br>
  It's on the reading list, but I didn't make it past the first chapter. Will try again eventually. ★
