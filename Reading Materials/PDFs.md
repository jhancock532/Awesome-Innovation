The PDF files can be accessed by the following links, where I retrieved them initally. 

### Design Thinking

[An Introduction to Design Thinking PROCESS GUIDE](
https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/sandbox/groups/designresources/wiki/36873/attachments/74b3d/ModeGuideBOOTCAMP2010L.pdf)
 - From the Institute of Design at Stanford.

 - I've actually read this one, it contains useful practical methods and tons of example exercise sheets that you could print out and use in innovation sessions. Doesn't subscribe to the four part innovation process, "next steps" and real world implementation has it's own catergory. Useful diagrams about the innovation process as a whole.
