# PDFs on Innovation

Pro tip! Use Google and search whatever you are interested in, then add pdf at the end of it. You get a lot more quality content instead of  blog posts recommending "5 ways to uncover impactful insights you won't believe!". 

### Design Thinking

[Design Thinking for Communications Professionals](https://apps.prsa.org/Network/_includes/Storytell.pdf)
 - "How Design Thinking processes can help you shape organizational stories that connect." *14 pages*

[An Introduction to Design Thinking PROCESS GUIDE](
https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/sandbox/groups/designresources/wiki/36873/attachments/74b3d/ModeGuideBOOTCAMP2010L.pdf)
 - From the Institute of Design at Stanford. *12 pages*

[Basics Design: Design Thinking](http://asimetrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/design-thinking.pdf)
 - "The art or practice of using your mind to design." *202 pages.*

[Design Thinking: The Guidebook](http://www.rcsc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dt-guide-book-master-copy.pdf)
 - I've actually read this one, it contains useful practical methods and tons of example exercise sheets that you could print out and use in innovation sessions. Doesn't subscribe to the four part innovation process, "next steps" and real world implementation has it's own catergory. Useful diagrams about the innovation process as a whole. 77 pages, but light material with diagrams - the other 70 pages are templates.

If any of the above links go down, I have a backup downloaded and I can send you the file.
