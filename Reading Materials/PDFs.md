# PDFs on Innovation

Pro tip! Use Google and search whatever you are interested in, then add pdf at the end of it. You get a lot more quality content instead of  blog posts recommending "5 ways to uncover impactful insights you won't believe!". In fact, the real problem is that there are **too many pdfs out there.** I'm going to investigate and try to dig out the good ones.

### [Systems Thinking](https://www.google.com/search?q=systems+thinking+pdf&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8b)

### [Design Thinking](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&client=firefox-b-ab&ei=bsJgW7rFEsSdgAbTiavoDg&q=design+thinking+pdf&oq=design+thinking+pdf&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l8j0i30k1l2.258745.260121.0.260379.8.7.0.0.0.0.175.576.0j4.4.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..5.3.419...0i7i30k1j0i13k1.0.MAVf-7fHTcE)

[Design Thinking: The Guidebook](http://www.rcsc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dt-guide-book-master-copy.pdf)
 - I've actually read this one, it contains useful practical methods and tons of example exercise sheets that you could print out and use in innovation sessions. Doesn't subscribe to the four part innovation process, "next steps" and real world implementation has it's own catergory. Useful diagrams about the innovation process as a whole. 77 pages, but light material with diagrams - the other 70 pages are templates.

If any of the above links go down, I have a backup downloaded and I can send you the file.
