# Innovation Books
If you are a new student, the single book I would recommend is [Cracking Creativity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-CreativitySecrets-Creative-Genius-Business/dp/1580083110/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421710&sr=1-1&keywords=cracking+creativity),  there is a copy in the Queen's library if you're lucky. 

* [The Ten Faces of Innovation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Faces-Innovation-Strategies-Heightening/dp/1781256152/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421841&sr=1-1&keywords=ten+faces+of+innovation) <br>
  It's on the reading list, and it's totally worth getting it. I have done a complete 180 on this one, I gave up after the first chapter the first time (I have no idea why), but having read it properly this time I fully support it. Don't confuse it with the 10 Belbin team roles like I might have done earlier - this book isn't trying to assign roles (it says this a few times), but provides insight into 10 different ways of being innovative. 
* [Think Like an Artist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Artist-Creative-Productive/dp/0241970806) <br>
  Explains how to think like an artist. If you are into the art-side, give it a go. 
* [Think Like a Designer (Don't Act Like One)](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Designer-Dont-Act/dp/9063694857) <br>
  Not really worth the cost, the design of this book triumphs over its substance. A quick read, 75 numbered insights - the context behind them isn't discussed in detail, but good to flick through for something to think about. Images are top class. 
* [Cracking Creativity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-CreativitySecrets-Creative-Genius-Business/dp/1580083110/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421710&sr=1-1&keywords=cracking+creativity) <br>
  How to come up with ideas and think creatively. This book isn't on your reading list, probably because it focuses on the narrow section of innovation that is ideation(coming up with ideas), but I'd like it to be, because ideation is the coolest and most misunderstood aspect of innovation.
* [Life's a Pitch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lifes-Pitch-Yourself-Brilliant-Ideas/dp/0552156833/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421745&sr=1-1&keywords=lifes+a+pitch) <br>
  How to pitch an idea, and also "how to live life successfully" (you have been warned, it gets weird). A good insight on most pages in the first half. Second half is less useful. 
* [Do Lead](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Lead-Vision-Inspire-Impossible/dp/1907974172) <br>
  Learn what a leader actually is - it's not what I thought. This book encouraged me to take on a more of a leaders role for an innovation project, even though I previously didn't identify that way at all. Found in Queens library. 
* [Do Protect](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Protect-Legal-Advice-Startups/dp/1907974156) <br>
  Covers the legal aspects of being a start-up. Availible in the Queens library, worth flick through if you see it there (You'll be surprised about all the things you have to worry about, or get your lawyer to worry about.)  
* [The Innovator's DNA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-DNA-Mastering-Skills-Disruptive/dp/1422134814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421874&sr=1-1&keywords=the+innovators+dna) <br>
  For business people. Contains five key "discovery skills". Good section on experimenting, not really worth 23 pounds though.

  
# Insightful Reading

### Storytelling

* [Into The Woods](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Woods-Stories-Work-Tell/dp/0141978104/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531422033&sr=1-1&keywords=into+the+woods) <br>
  How stories work, explaining underlying story structure and story archetype theory. Well written, highly insightful, and you'll take away a whole new perspective on films and books.
* [Do Story](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Story-World-Listens-Books/dp/1907974059/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RG74XJAH1MYKXW9EYSA5) <br>
  Good general tips for telling a good story. Not as fundamental as Into the Woods, but it's in Queens library, so you've got nothing to lose.
  
### Common Sense
 
* [Notes on a Nervous Planet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Notes-Nervous-Planet-Matt-Haig/dp/1786892677) <br>
  You are enough as you are. Notes on a Nervous Planet is written in a warm, friendly tone, and is very readable. Emphasis on maintaining perspective of what matters in todays society, and that all your wants might not by as important as you think. 
* [Selfie (How the west became self-obsessed)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Selfie-How-West-Became-Self-Obsessed/dp/144728366X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531422065&sr=1-1&keywords=selfie) <br>
  Brings a revealing map to perfectionism, self improvement, personal image and individualism. Will Storr shows how the mess of societies ideals came about, and provides a liberating perspective on this madness we live in.
* [The Age of Absurdity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Age-Absurdity-Modern-makes-Happy/dp/1847396275) <br>
  A broader and lighter read than Selfie, from an author who by different means is tackling the same theme. Michael Foley makes more generalisations about the individual, which Will Storr tries to avoid, but this seems to make it a more relatable book.
