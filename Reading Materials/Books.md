## Innovation Books

* [Think Like an Artist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Artist-Creative-Productive/dp/0241970806) <br>
  Explains how to think like an artist. I should read it again. ★★★
* [Cracking Creativity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-CreativitySecrets-Creative-Genius-Business/dp/1580083110/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421710&sr=1-1&keywords=cracking+creativity) <br>
  How to come up with ideas and think creatively. This book is on your reading list. You should read it. ★★★
* [Life's a Pitch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lifes-Pitch-Yourself-Brilliant-Ideas/dp/0552156833/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421745&sr=1-1&keywords=lifes+a+pitch) <br>
  How to pitch an idea, and also "how to live life successfully" (you have been warned, it gets **weird**). A good insight on most pages in the first half. Second half is pretty useless. ★★★
* [Do Lead](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Lead-Vision-Inspire-Impossible/dp/1907974172) <br>
  Learn what a leader actually is. It turns out that there are many flavours, and **you** are already a leader. Found in Queens library. ★★★
* [Do Protect](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Protect-Legal-Advice-Startups/dp/1907974156) <br>
  Covers the legal aspects of being a start-up. Availible in the Queens library, worth a go (You'll be surprised about all the things you have to worry about, or get your lawyer to worry about.)  ★★★
* [The Innovator's DNA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-DNA-Mastering-Skills-Disruptive/dp/1422134814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421874&sr=1-1&keywords=the+innovators+dna) <br>
  For business people. Contains five key "discovery skills". Good section on experimenting, not really worth 23 pounds though. ★★
* [The Ten Faces of Innovation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Faces-Innovation-Strategies-Heightening/dp/1781256152/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531421841&sr=1-1&keywords=ten+faces+of+innovation) <br>
  It's on the reading list, but I didn't make it past the first chapter. Will try again eventually. ★
  
## Good Reads in General 

* [Into The Woods](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Woods-Stories-Work-Tell/dp/0141978104/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531422033&sr=1-1&keywords=into+the+woods) <br>
  How stories work. Underlying story structure and story archetype theory. Well written, highly insightful.
* [Do Story](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Do-Story-World-Listens-Books/dp/1907974059/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RG74XJAH1MYKXW9EYSA5) <br>
  Good general tips for telling a good story. Not as fundamental as Into the Woods, but it's in Queens library, so you've got nothing to lose.
* [Selfie (How the west became self-obsessed)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Selfie-How-West-Became-Self-Obsessed/dp/144728366X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531422065&sr=1-1&keywords=selfie) <br>
  Perfectionism, self improvement, personal image, individualism. Will Storr provides a wonderful, liberating perspective on this madness we live in.
